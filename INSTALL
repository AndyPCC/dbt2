Building DBT-2:

	# Configure (-DDESTDIR: DESTDIR to be used by make install)
	cmake -DDBMS=<drizzle|mysql|pgsql|sapdb> -DDESTDIR=/usr/local
	# Build
	make

-----

Installing DBT-2:

	make install DESTDIR=/usr/local

DESTDIR could be omitted here if already specified in cmake as -DDESTDIR.
This will put all binaries in '/usr/local/bin'.

-----

Uninstalling DBT-2:

	xargs rm < install_manifest.txt

The file 'install_manifest.txt' will be created after running 'make install'.

-----

Running DBT-2

The kit requires R to be installed for basic post processing and plotting of
transaction data.
