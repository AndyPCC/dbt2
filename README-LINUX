If you want readprofile data, you need to give the database user sudo access
to run readprofile.  Root privileges are required to clear the counter data.
Here is an example of passwordless access for user 'postgres' to run
'readprofile -r':

postgres ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/readprofile -r

The number of open files will likely need to be raised for the on the systems
that are driving the database.  One way to do this permanently is to edit
/etc/security/limits.conf.  Here is an example for the user 'postgres':

postgres         soft    nofile          40000
postgres         hard    nofile          40000

One of the shared memory parameters will likely needs to be raised on the
database system in order to accomidate increasing the shared_buffers parameter
in PostgreSQL.  One way to do this permanently is to edit /etc/sysctl.conf and
add:

kernel.shmmax = 41943040
