The kit is configured to expect PostgreSQL to have trusted connections defined.
So in the pg_hba.conf file, if you want to trust everyone, define this:

local        all                                           trust
host         all         127.0.0.1     255.0.0.0           trust
host         all         0.0.0.0       0.0.0.0             reject

-----

PostgreSQL needs to be built with a change in pg_config.h.in to set
INDEX_MAX_KEYS to 64.

-----

Contrary to the documentation, run 'make' instead of 'make standalone' and
run the kit in a multi-tier environment for PostgreSQL.

-----

Edit the line in postgresql.conf that says "tcpip_socket = false", uncomment,
set to true, and restart the daemon.
