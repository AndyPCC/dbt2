PostgreSQL
----------

1. Make the stored functions return the data that they're supposed to.  It's
   really not needed for how the workload is driven, but it would be nice to
   be a little more proper.

2. Make use of arrays for passing data into a stored function.  That way we
   don't have to recompile PostgreSQL to support more than 32 parameters for
   the stored functions.
